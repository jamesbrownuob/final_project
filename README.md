# DaRT + DNA damage Simulation

Simulate a DaRT seed and the associated DNA damage in a two part simulation.

## Origin
Repo created from two repos:
  - git@github.com:lg9783/DaRT.git/main at commit cf85bac0cef4292bd5818d35b9e3141e5a319558 
  - git@github.com:lg9783/RBE.git/main at commit 687700c5cde0efff0275dbc8966887792f094a65

## Overview
The two parts of the simulation are:

1. [The DaRT seed simulation](./DaRT), simulates the seed and saves the particle distribution in rings at different radii from the seed.
1. The particle distribution provides the input to the [DNA damage simulation](./DNA_damage) which simulates the DNA damage in a specified radius from the seed due to the particle distribution.

More details on how to setup, compile and run each are in the readme files: [DaRT](./DaRT/README.md) and [DNA_damage](./DNA_damage/README.md).

## Example of how to run
This is an example of how to run both parts of the simulation. After both components have been compiled (assumed to be in a folder called 'build'), and the DNA geometry has been created by running (./DNA_damage/geometryFiles/writeContinuousGeometry.py).

First make a folder in the same directory as this readme called "results"

### DaRT simulation

Create the dart simulation input file (dart.in) and save in results
```
/run/verbose 1
/control/verbose 2
/det/cellPos_min 200 micrometer
/det/cellPos_max 5000 micrometer
/det/cellPos_Nrings 10
/run/initialize
/gun/particle ion
/gun/ion 88 224 0 0
/run/printProgress 1
/run/beamOn 10
```

Run the dart simulation, from the [results file](results)
```
../DaRT/build/dart -mac dart.in -out example_simulation  -seed 1
```

This should run quickly and create two files:
1. example_simulation.root - this contains information about the simulation and a few basic plots
1. example_simulation.bin - this contains the saved particle spectrum (in binary format to save space)

### DNA damage simulation

The DNA damage simulation consists of two steps:
1. Geant4 simulation
2. Calculation of DNA damage clusters from the Geant4 simulation results

Run the DNA_damage Geant4 simulation, again from the [results file](results):
```
../DNA_damage/simulation/build/rbe -mac ../DNA_damage/simulation/rbe_PS.in -decayPS example_simulation.bin -out example_simulation_DNA -sugar ../DNA_damage/geometryFiles/sugarPos_n2_300nm_H75nm_R11nm_33hist_50deg.bin -histone ../DNA_damage/geometryFiles/histonePos_n2_300nm_H75nm_R11nm_33hist_50deg.bin -seed 1 
```
This will take longer than the last simulation and should create a new root file called example_simulation_DNA.root. This contains all the energy depositions and radical reactions needed to calculate the DNA damage.

Run the DNA damage clustering algorithm, for the first ring (specified using --copy) in the DaRT simulation, again from the [results file](results). The example below will included all particles in the decay chain in the DNA damage calculation.

```
source ../DNA_damage/Clustering/build/clustering/bin/activate

python ../DNA_damage/Clustering/run.py --filename example_simulation_DNA.root --output example_simulation_DNA_copy0.csv --sugar ../DNA_damage/geometryFiles/sugarPos_n2_300nm_H75nm_R11nm_33hist_50deg.bin --continuous 1 --copy 0 --simulationType=decay --part1_particleSource "[alphaRa224,alphaRn220,alphaPo216,alphaBi212,alphaPo212,e-Rn220,e-Po216,e-Pb212,e-Bi212,e-Tl208,e-Po212,gammaRn220,gammaPo216,gammaPb212,gammaBi212,gammaTl208,gammaPo212]"
 
```
This will create two output files for the DNA damage at the first (copy number 0, as is zero indexed) radius:
1. Number of strand breaks, SSB, cSSB and DSB for each event, and for direct and indirect effects.
1. DSB cluster size information.

Functions to analyse these files can be found in [DNA_damage/Clustering/readResults.py](DNA_damage/Clustering/readResults.py)
